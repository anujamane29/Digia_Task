Created a page with [Your, all, blocked] cards tabs. MERN Project The main objective of this project is to create a web page that displays cards with different types and owner IDs. The cards can be of two types: 'burner' or 'subscription'. For 'burner' cards, the expiry date is displayed in the card design, while for 'subscription' cards, the limit is shown. The card type is displayed on the top right corner of each card.

Users can click on different tabs ('Your', 'All', 'Blocked') to see cards belonging to them based on owner IDs. The application supports infinite scrolling to fetch more data from the API, with each API call fetching 10 records. Users can also search for cards by name and filter cards by type.
